# HealthClinic

An iOS & Android app that parses images of food to provide nutritional information.

The logic on the backend uses [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-bramin) to parse the image and determine the food. The food is then logged in a database and added to the list.
